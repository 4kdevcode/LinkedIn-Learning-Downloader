## How to Obtain Your `li_at` Token Using EditThisCookie

The `li_at` token is a LinkedIn authentication token that is necessary for the LinkedIn Learning Downloader to function. You can retrieve this token from your browser by using the EditThisCookie extension. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install the EditThisCookie Extension
1. Go to your browser's web store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Brave, etc.).
2. Search for "EditThisCookie" and select the extension.
3. Click "Add to Browser" to install the extension.

### Step 2: Access LinkedIn
1. Open your browser and navigate to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning).
2. Log in with your LinkedIn credentials.

### Step 3: Use EditThisCookie to Retrieve the `li_at` Token
1. Once logged in, click on the EditThisCookie icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears as a cookie or a pencil icon.
2. A list of cookies will appear. Scroll through them or use the search bar to find the cookie named `li_at`.
3. Click on the `li_at` cookie to expand its details.
4. Copy the Value field of the `li_at` cookie. This is the token needed by the LinkedIn Learning Downloader.

### Step 4: Use the Token in the LinkedIn Learning Downloader
1. Open the LinkedIn Learning Downloader.
2. Navigate to the settings or authentication section where the `li_at` token is required.
3. Paste the token into the designated field and save your settings.

### Note
- **Keep your `li_at` token secure** and do not share it with others. This token gives access to your LinkedIn account.
- If you encounter issues with the token or it appears to be invalid, try logging out of LinkedIn and then logging back in to generate a new token.
