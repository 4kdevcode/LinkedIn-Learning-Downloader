## Compatibility
The LinkedIn Learning Downloader is built as a standalone application using Nuitka, which means it includes all necessary Python and PyQt libraries. There is no need to install Python or any specific libraries on your system to run this tool. Simply download and run the installer, and the application will operate smoothly on any Windows system that meets the basic operating requirements.

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 7 or later.
- Hard Disk Space: At least 100 MB free for installation and additional space for downloaded courses.
- Internet Connection: Required for downloading courses and updates.

## How to Use the Open Source Scripts

To use the open-source scripts, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.12**:
   - Download Python 3.12 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - Ensure that Python is added to your PATH during the installation process.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Add your token and course link in the `config.py` file.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

## How to Obtain Your `li_at` Token Using EditThisCookie

The `li_at` token is a LinkedIn authentication token that is necessary for the LinkedIn Learning Downloader to function. You can retrieve this token from your browser by using the EditThisCookie extension. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Install the EditThisCookie Extension
1. Go to your browser's web store (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Brave, etc.).
2. Search for "EditThisCookie" and select the extension.
3. Click "Add to Browser" to install the extension.

### Step 2: Access LinkedIn
1. Open your browser and navigate to [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning).
2. Log in with your LinkedIn credentials.

### Step 3: Use EditThisCookie to Retrieve the `li_at` Token
1. Once logged in, click on the EditThisCookie icon in your browser's toolbar. It usually appears as a cookie or a pencil icon.
2. A list of cookies will appear. Scroll through them or use the search bar to find the cookie named `li_at`.
3. Click on the `li_at` cookie to expand its details.
4. Copy the Value field of the `li_at` cookie. This is the token needed by the LinkedIn Learning Downloader.

### Step 4: Use the Token in the LinkedIn Learning Downloader
1. Open the LinkedIn Learning Downloader.
2. Navigate to the settings or authentication section where the `li_at` token is required.
3. Paste the token into the designated field and save your settings.

### Note
- **Keep your `li_at` token secure** and do not share it with others. This token gives access to your LinkedIn account.
- If you encounter issues with the token or it appears to be invalid, try logging out of LinkedIn and then logging back in to generate a new token.
